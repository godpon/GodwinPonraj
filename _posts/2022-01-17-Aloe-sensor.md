        Ionic pressure sensors are made of ionic compounds suspended in a suitable solvent mixture. When external pressure is exerted on them, it is reflected as a change in electrical parameters due to physical deformation and a redistribution of ions within the sensing medium. Variations in the composition and material of the sensing medium result in different pressure sensors with varying operating ranges and sensitivity. This work presents the design and fabrication procedure of a novel soft-pressure sensor for a very low-pressure range (<20 mm Hg) using Aloe vera gel and Glycerin as the solvent for the ionic sensing medium.

We also provide a comparative study on the performance of sensor prototypes with varying solvent concentrations and geometric parameters based on a series of characterization experiments. Maximum sensitivity (7.498×10−4 Ω/mmHg) was observed when using 40% glycerin in the sensing medium, filled in a toroidal geometry with outer and inner channel diameters of 8 mm and 7 mm, respectively. The proposed sensor is entirely soft and can be designed to conform to any desired geometry.
