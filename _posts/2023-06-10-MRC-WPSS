## Abstract

In this project, we shall discuss a novel wireless power sharing scheme using magnetic resonance coupling (MRC-WPSS), 
where a single transmission system can simultaneously transmit power and control the distributed between two entirely passive receiving sides. 
This will not only facilitate the device operation without on-board battery but also provides the ability to control the said device based on the amount of power it receives. 
For example, two heaters used in therapy around the same region can be wirelessly powered and controlled to effect different temperatures. 
While most existing solutions choose either selectivity or power manipulation, our proposed system aims to achieve an optimal solution between power sharing and selectivity. 
Simulation results support our claim that, by selecting the transmission side capacitance and by designing sufficiently overlapping receiving side resonant profiles, 
the desired load-sharing profile can be achieved between the two secondaries. 
A simple experimental prototype was designed using resistive heaters as the two secondary loads. 
Experimental results show the load sharing at different temperatures in the two heaters.
The proposed wireless power transfer design can be used in simple remote applications that benefit from power control, such as remotely controllable heaters and robotic actuations.

You can enable MathJax by setting `mathjax: true` on a page or globally in the `_config.yml`. Some examples:

[Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) relates the  complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions.

$$ e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) $$

The [Euler-Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) differential equation is the fundamental equation of calculus of variations.

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} $$

The [SchrÃ¶dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time.

$$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$

## Code

Embed code by putting `{{ "{% highlight language " }}%}` `{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}` blocks around it. Adding the parameter `linenos` will show source lines besides the code.

{% highlight c %}

static void asyncEnabled(Dict* args, void* vAdmin, String* txid, struct Allocator* requestAlloc)
{
    struct Admin* admin = Identity_check((struct Admin*) vAdmin);
    int64_t enabled = admin->asyncEnabled;
    Dict d = Dict_CONST(String_CONST("asyncEnabled"), Int_OBJ(enabled), NULL);
    Admin_sendMessage(&d, txid, admin);
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Gists

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.
