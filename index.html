  I am a fourth year Ph.D student in Department of Biomedical Engineering, National University of Singapore under the supervision of Assoc. Prof. Hongliang Ren.
  I am currently working on integrating origami and kirigami designs into close-range chip-less RF sensing for use in biomedical applications.
  I also have experience and a demonstrated history working with tactile sensors - focused on fabrication and integration with robotic manipulators.
